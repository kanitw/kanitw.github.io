A large ratio of students per teacher in the massive online courses introduces difficulties for the assessment of students’ work especially for open ended assignments.  Peer review is one possible solution for scaling assessment of open-ended assignments in massive online courses.  However, the amount of data from the peer review system makes it difficult for teaching staff to explore and understand the review data.

Peereviz utilized existing text visualization techniques as well as multiple coordinated views to explore the massive scale of data in the peer review system of massive online courses.
