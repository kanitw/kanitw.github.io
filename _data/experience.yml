  title: Graduate Student Researcher
  date: Since 2015
  location: Seattle, WA
  advisors: James Fogarty, Amy Ko
  caption: I designed and developed 4 systems applying constraint solving, data-driven design, and machine learning to aid UI/UX designers
    in their use of examples and alternatives and conducting usability evaluations within interactive design tools, while collaborating with industry companies (i.e., Adobe, 
    Google).

  caption: I conducted a company-wide survey on information capture from mobile devices, and collaborated with <b>two 
    product teams</b> to develop a cross-device system (i.e. mobile and desktop) for capturing and linking document-related information (e.g., 
    photos, bookmarks).

  date: 2018
  location: Mountain View, CA
  mentors: Yang Li
  caption: I developed a crowdsourcing interface, and collected a dataset of over 20k labels through Mechanical Turk, 
    and constructed a <b>deep neural network model</b> (Tensorflow) to automatically predict the tappability of mobile interfaces to help designers evaluate tappability
    of their interfaces without needing to collect any data.

  caption: I created <b>Rewire</b>, an interactive system helping designers leverage example screenshots by automatically inferring a 
    vector representation with editable shape and style properties, including 3 novel design assistance modes, and evaluated Rewire with 16 
    interface designers.

  caption: I designed and implemented <b>CogTool-Helper</b>, which uses UI testing frameworks to 
    automatically create storyboards for predictive human performance modeling of user interfaces, 
    to help designers evaluate human performance and detect human performance regressions in interfaces.
