<!--I love food and I am lucky that both Thai and Teochew food are awesome.
 If you can take me to a good Teochew restaurant here in the US, I will treat you to a meal!-->

#### Childhood: Lego, Computers, Design and Computers!

I was born in Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, and lived there for 22 years with my big [Thai Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Thailand) [family](#family).  As a Chinese descendant, I also have my Chinese name–黄德镇 (Huang-de-zhen in Mandarin or Ng-Tek-Ting in [Teochew]())[^chinese-name].

I did my formative studies at [Assumption College][] in Bangkok from grades 1 to 12.  I remembered playing Lego with my brother and trying to build new stuff from houses, castles to spaceships from those magical bricks everyday after school.

[Assumption College]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_College_(Thailand)

After Lego, computer had become my brother and my main toy when my dad bought our first computer, originally for his work.  Within a short period, he had to buy another computer as we always occupied it.  However, his plan did not work since both computers became occupied all the time instead–one by me and one by my brother.  As a result, my dad had to buy a third computer and another one a few years later after my sister started to occupy the third one.  While most of our friends enjoyed Nintendo 64 and subsequently Sony Playstation consoles, our toys were always computers.  Moreover, as we had so many computers, my friends often joked that my home was Wongsuphasawat Computer Center when they visited.

<!--I also liked Scrabble and I won the Primary School league in the National Scrabble Championship[^Scrabble].-->
<!--TODO: Put kiddy picture -->


My interests in design and technology emerged in my grade 7, when I followed my brother to join the school's Graphics and Internet club, in which I learned how to use Photoshop and HTML to design websites.
I then became interested in a club right next door, the Olympic in Informatics Club (ACIOI[^ACIOI]), which I subsequently joined and learned how to use programming and algorithms to solve programming challenges <!--[]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)-->.  It was as fun as playing games. Before I really noticed, I was selected to join the National Olympiad in Informatics camp for two consecutive years in Grade 10 and 11.  <!--I was also named an alternative national candidate for the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).-->  Meanwhile, I still developed my love for design and headed the [design of my school's yearbook](/project/acyearbook.md).

#### College life at Chulalongkorn University

With love for programming and design and influence from parents who are entrepreneurs, I hoped to study Computer Engineering, Product Design and Business.
 However, undergraduate interdisciplinary education was largely limited in Thailand so I can only chose one.
I finally entered the Computer Engineering [^ComEng] program at Chulalongkorn University.

<!-- picture of calculus guide-->

Prior programming experience from the Olympiad Camp gave me a lot of free times for extracurricular activities including joining [Photography Club](#cuphoto), taking [Charcoal Drawing Class](#drawing), and authoring [a Calculus Solution Guide](#calculus-guide).
Moreover, my friends and I also formed a number of<!--TODO find better word--> teams to compete in local Software competitions and built software like [Vidview](/project/vidview.html) and [FaceSpot](/project/facespot.html]).
I also joined [Plasma-Z team](/project/plasmaz.html) in the Robot Club to develop soccer robots system and competed in the [International Robocup](http://www.robocup.org/).
These projects helped me not only learn even more than from the classes but also discover my passion in the making technology for people.
Even in the Robotic club where I supposed to design a robotics system, one of the things that intrigued me the most was designing UI for our team members to test the system easily and more effectively.

<!--TODO is robotic or robotics-->

Another good thing about these projects is if you did well, then you have a chance for free trips abroad.  I went to Singapore, Malaysia and Austria as my rewards.  The trip that was the most influential for me was the [Stanford Thai Exchange Program (STEP)](http://www.stanford.edu/group/thais/cgi-bin/step/home.php) in 2008.  Although, the program was just three weeks, I am very inspired by the entrepreneurial spirits and energy of people in Stanford and Silicon Valley.  Those experience included visiting tech companies like Google, Facebook, and attending Stanford's [Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders Seminar](http://etl.stanford.edu/).  I am also amazed by the interdisplinary nature of Stanford Education.  For example, my host was an Economics student but he knew about new technology and startups even average of most of engineering students at my school.  After STEP, the idea of coming back to Stanford for graduate studies always sticked in my mind.

Back to Chulalongkorn University, I was busy with projects and thesis. Right after my undergraduate thesis presentation, I had ten days to apply for the Fulbright Scholarship.  I knew that I wanted to become a person who could bridge the gap between technology and people. So I was deciding between Computer Science with focus in Human-computer Interaction and Engineer Management (with focus on Entrepreneurship).  Both looked great for my goal. Within that short time, I chose Engineering Management simply because Stanford's Engineering Management ([MS&E][msande]) program is famous for entrepreneurship course and also very flexible for taking courses in other department including Computer Science and Design[^HCI].  More importantly, I felt that I should study something different from my elder brother, who was doing a PhD in Human-computer Interaction at the time.

#### Fulbright scholar and Stanford University

I was fortunate to win the Fulbright Scholarship and went through writing graduate schools application while working full-time at Thomson Reuters.  Finally, my dream came true.  I was admitted to Stanford University.

In the first week at Stanford, I was deciding if I should take the Intro to HCI course (CS147).  After the first lecture, I knew that I just had to take it and after that I kept taking more HCI and design courses.  (Thanks for MS&E program's flexibility that allows me to do that!)  While I also enjoyed MS&E courses, it was HCI and Design that motivated and woke me up to work each day.  Some of my friends at Stanford even thought that I was a Computer Science student.

I also started doing research.  I was also fortunate to work with a number of wonderful researchers including Amin Saberi and Farnaz Ronaghi for the Venture Lab Project, Neema Moraveji for the Breathwear Project, Elin Pedersen and Bay Chang at Google's HCI group in summer and currently with Scott Klemmer and Chinmay Kulkarni for Peer Assessment in Online Classroom.

At this point, I am planning to continue to do my PhD in Computer Science/Human-computer Interaction next year. (I have been accepted to a few schools, let's see where will be my final destination!)

Thank you so much for reading.  I hope you enjoyed it and hope it help you know me more.  After reading all of this long bio, please feel free to shoot me an email to ask questions or comment.  I also have a FAQ section below too.

[^chinese-name]:  If you want to call me attention, trying to call my Chinese name in Mandarin might not work since I am not used to it.

[^ACIOI]: ACIOI was an acronym for Assumption College International Olympiad in Informatics.  We included "International" in the name is because our club was so successful at having members winning medals from the [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics).

<!--[^Scrabble]: To be precise, it is actually the National Crossword Championship.  Scrabble is called *Crossword* in Thailand probably due to license issue.-->
<!--[^Chinese-Thai]: By saying Chinese-Thai, I am not ethnically mixed blood.  Most of my ancestry lines are rooted from China but since our family lives in-->

[^ComEng]: Computer Engineering programs in Thailand are very similar to Computer Science program in United States.  Most universities also often have Computer Science department in Faculties of Science but Computer Engineering programs are more popular. (In Thailand, we adopted British system and call use the term "Faculty of Science" rather than "School of Science")

[^HCI]: In hindsight, actually most HCI master's program are also flexible as well due to its interdisciplinary nature.  But I did not know back then.

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Why both Kanit and Ham? {#why-ham}

In general, Thai people usually have one formal first name and another short nickname that can be any short Thai, English or Chinese word that might not be related to our first name at all.  For example, I have friends who named Jump, Bird, etc.

For my name *Ham*, it is my parent's word play.  My brother's nickname is Muu, which means pig in Thai.  Since Ham is made from pork, Thai people commonly call Ham(the meat) transliterally "Muu-Ham".  So we are "Muu-Ham" brothers.

So *Kanit* is my formal first name but *Ham* is what people who know me personally call me. And yes, *Ham* is actually an English word that means *meat from the upper part of a pig's leg salted and dried or smoked*.  I generally prefer people to call me *Ham* since most people cannot pronounce *Kanit* correctly.

##### Why are Thai people's surnames so long? {#surname}

Many Thai-Chinese families have very long Thai surnames because we named our surnames lately (mostly during my dad's generation) and we had creative freedom to create surnames with good meanings.  So if you see Asian/Chinese-looking people with long surnames, I can bet that they are from Thailand.  For my surname,  *Wong* means family in Thai,  *Supha* means happiness, wealth, or goodness and *Sawat* also means goodness, prosperity.  So my family name roughly means *family of happiness and prosperity*.

You might also notice that *Wong* from Wongsuphasawat is actually *Huáng*(黄) in Cantonese[^Huang].  Basically, many Thai Chinese families including mine intentionally hid our Chinese surname in our Thai surname.  Now, you might also notice why this domain is yellowpigz.com. (Huáng means yellow and my brother and my names are both related to pig.)


##### How is your family like? {#family}

In Bangkok, my large, warm family consists of 10 people living in the same house–my dad, mom, brother, sister,  grandpa, grandma, auntie, her husband, and their son.
I am the fifth generation of my [Thai Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_people_in_Thailand) family since we first migrated to Thailand.

My dad and mom are my heroes.  They are pharmacists and entrepreneurs who pioneered the concept of chain drugstores and the usage of vitamin supplements in Thailand.  Besides my dad's work in business, he also currently teaches at Mae-Fah Luang University.  My mom is always cheerful and optimistic.  Although they work hard, they always care about me and support me in what I want to do.  Inspired by my parents, I hope to become an entrepreneur who uses technical knowledge to positively impact the society.

My brother, [Krist](http://krist.yellowpigz.com]) (Muu), is closest to me in the family.  In some sense, he is also my best friend.  When we were young, we shared every toy and always played together.  We both love soccer and Manchester United.  As we grow up, we share similar interests in Computer and Design.  Actually, he studied Human-Computer Interaction too.  We are also close to our little sister, Nicha, too.  We often take a picture of three of us and joke people that we are actually triplets.

I am also very close to my grandparents.  When I was in primary school, my grandpa always taught us English and Math after school.  That certainly provided me with a strong fundamental knowledge.  My grandma is also a great chef.  While I am in the United States, her food is one of the things I miss the most.

##### How is Chulalongkorn Photography Club like? {#cuphoto}

One of my best memories was being a member of Chulalongkorn University Photography Club.  Every year, we had a trip to National parks and take pictures of flowers and landscapes.  We also liked taking portrait pictures.  In one of our trips, we wore jacket suites to take pictures in a corn field like a rockstar.

##### How did you come up with the Calculus Guide idea? {#calculus-guide}

As I was good at Math during high school and the National University Entrance Examination, a lot of my college friends bugged me to teach them Calculus during the first year.  Well, teaching them all one by one was not a feasible solution.  Meanwhile, photocopying (*xerox*) was really cheap in Thailand.
Thus, I neatly wrote my solution when I worked on the exercise problems from the textbooks and just let my friends photocopied it to use as solution guide.  In our freshman Calculus classes, besides the lecture, students were left to study on their own without either teaching assistant or problem solving guide.  Thus, my guide–in fact, more like scratch papers–became widely popular especially in the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Science.
A week before the freshmen exam, I even had to carry several copies of this solution guide to distribute to my friends. Hundreds of students owned copies of it during my freshman year and many gave them to their juniors.  As a result, these copies of my guide have helped over a thousand people to date and students are still using my guide today. Not bad for scratch paper and simple bootstrapping efforts, right?

Later in 2011, I was curious about Facebook Fan Page's functionality so I did a fun experiment creating a [page for the guide](http://www.facebook.com/hamcalculus) without really promoting it.  Although it has been five years after I first distributed, it has so far earned over 700 likes and also some thank you posts.


##### So you have also mastered Charcoal drawing? {#drawing}

Actually, no.  But I am very happy that I did try.
The short story was that while I did pretty well in my freshman year, studying only theoretical subjects get me bored.  So I and one of my best friend, Billy, went to an Art school to study Charcoal Drawing.

I remembered we were talking about how some of our friends practiced playing guitars to sing songs for their girls, so maybe we could master drawing and draw pictures for girls too.  Although we later discovered that Charcoal drawing was extremely difficult and we did not have enough time to master it, it was just memorable that we were two unorthodox engineering students who carried drawing boards around the engineering school.  At least, this helped me make good conversation with friends since many of them asked me why was I carrying "this thing around".

##### What is exactly your MS&E master's program? {#msande}

At Stanford, Management Science and Engineering department (MS&E) is a merger from three small, independent departments (Engineering Economic Systems, Operations Research, and Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management).
As a result of a merger, the department has a broad interdisciplinary nature.  MS&E Master's program is very flexible with 8 main concentration that student can choose.  Student can also design their own concentration with in any engineering and related discipline. For my case, I designed my dual concentration in Human-computer Interaction and Entrepreneurship.
