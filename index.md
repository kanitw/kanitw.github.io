title: Hi! I'm Kanit "Ham" Wongsuphasawat.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University Washington](http://www.uw.edu) (UW), focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization.
I work with [Prof. Jeffrey Heer](http://jheer.org) and the [UW Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu]).

<!-- My research explores __the design of interactive visualization systems for data science__.
I co-authors many visualization tools including [__Voyager__](http://github.com/vega/voyager), a recommendation-powered visual analysis tool, as well as the [__Vega-Lite__](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) and [__Vega__](http://vega.github.io/vega) declarative languages for interactive visualizations.  I also led the design of the [ __TensorFlow Graph Visualizer__](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/tfgraph), that ships with Google’s [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) to help developers inspect dataflow graphs of their machine learning models.  These tools have received awards at premier academic venues, and are used by [Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Graph), the [Jupyter/Python data science communities](https://altair-viz.github.io/), and TensorFlow users.

Previously, I worked at leading data-driven technology companies including [Google](http://www.google.com),
[Tableau Software](http://www.tableausoftware.com), [Thomson Reuters](http://thomsonreuters.com), and [Trifacta](http://www.trifacta.com).  Prior to UW, I was a [Fulbright scholar](http://www.cies.org/) and received a  MS in [Management Science & Engineering](http://msande.stanford.edu) from Stanford University. I also holds a B.Eng with First Honor and Gold Medal in [Computer Engineering](http://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th) from [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th) in Thailand.

In my free time, I am passionate about food and loves watching soccer and basketball. -->
