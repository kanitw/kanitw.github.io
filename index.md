title: Hi! I'm Kanit "Ham" Wongsuphasawat.
---

I am a tech lead of the Visualization team at Databricks.
Prior to Databricks, I was a research scientist and manager at Apple, where I worked on visualization toolkits and interactive systems for artificial intelligence.
I did my PhD in Computer Science at the [University Washington](http://www.uw.edu) (UW), working with [Prof. Jeffrey Heer](http://jheer.org) and the [UW Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu]).

<!--My interests lie in the intersection of user interfaces systems, data visualization, and data science. My PhD research focuses on enhancing visualization tools with automated design and recommendation for applications including exploratory data analysis and understanding deep learning models.-->
Systems I developed have won awards at premier academic venues, and are [used by the Jupyter/Python data science communities](https://altair-viz.github.io/), [Apple developers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts) and leading tech companies including [Apple](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vega-lite&type=), [Goo](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz)[gle](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=/v2/external/notebooks/charts.ipynb&scrollTo=beTgCbVa_wFA), [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft/vegalite-for-powerbi), [Netflix](https://twitter.com/oceankidbilly/status/931633519813582848), Twitter, and Uber.
Here is [an overview talk covering my PhD research](https://youtu.be/62k_JMOgFcc).

<!--I look forward to studying and designing more tools that facilitate people, both experts and novices, to work with and benefit more from data via visualization and artificial intelligence.-->

<!-- My research explores __the design of interactive visualization systems for data science__.
I co-authors many visualization tools including [__Voyager__](http://github.com/vega/voyager), a recommendation-powered visual analysis tool, as well as the [__Vega-Lite__](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) and [__Vega__](http://vega.github.io/vega) declarative languages for interactive visualizations.  I also led the design of the [ __TensorFlow Graph Visualizer__](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/tfgraph), that ships with Googleâ€™s [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) to help developers inspect dataflow graphs of their machine learning models.  These tools have received awards at premier academic venues, and are used by [Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Graph), the [Jupyter/Python data science communities](https://altair-viz.github.io/), and TensorFlow users.

<!--Previously, I worked at leading data-driven technology companies including [Google](http://www.google.com),
[Tableau Software](http://www.tableausoftware.com), [Thomson Reuters](http://thomsonreuters.com), and [Trifacta](http://www.trifacta.com).  Prior to UW, I was a [Fulbright scholar](http://www.cies.org/) and received a  MS in [Management Science & Engineering](http://msande.stanford.edu) from Stanford University. I also holds a B.Eng with First Honor and Gold Medal in [Computer Engineering](http://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th) from [Chulalongkorn University](http://www.chula.ac.th) in Thailand.

In my free time, I am passionate about food and loves watching soccer and basketball. -->
